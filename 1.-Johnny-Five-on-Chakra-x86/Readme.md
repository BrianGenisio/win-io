# Step 1
## Get Johnny-Five working on Chakra x86

I'm not sure if this step is necessary.  It would be nice to debug any Chakra-related issues on an x86 or x64 machine.  [This release](https://github.com/Microsoft/node/releases/tag/node-chakracore-6.0.0-pre2) of Node/Chakra works in Windows, and we can use it if we need to debug in a full-blown Windows env.


### Notes
Put any notes, links, etc here about getting this working
