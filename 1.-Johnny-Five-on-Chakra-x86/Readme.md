# Step 1
## Get Johnny-Five working on Chakra x86

I'm not sure if this step is necessary.  It would be nice to debug any Chakra-related issues on an x86 or x64 machine, but I can't find any examples of Node/Chakra working on anything other than IoT.  I tried to get it working on Windows 10 in a VM, but it didn't work.  I should try [this release](https://github.com/Microsoft/node/releases/tag/node-chakracore-6.0.0-pre2) of Node/Chakra ASAP.

This will hopefully work out of the box, but if not, it is a much better place to figure out why not.  Test with a couple of different platforms:
