# Step 2
## Get Johnny-Five working on a Raspberry Pi in Windows with Arduino

This will build upon [Step 1](https://github.com/BrianGenisio/win-io/tree/master/1.-Johnny-Five-on-Chakra-x86).  Instead of running on a PC (or VM), run on Chakra ARM directly on the Raspberry Pi.

### Notes
- Try to use  [this workflow](https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/samples/NodejsCylon.htm).  I think it will be much more rapid than developing in Visual Studio and sending the package over every time.  It will mount the Pi drive on the dev box, and run node from remote shell.
