This project is in the early exploration stage.  There is nothing usable as of yet.  We've laid out four steps to a mature release, though these steps will likely morph over time.

## Maturity
1. [ ] [1. Johnny-Five running on Chakra Node x86](https://github.com/BrianGenisio/win-io/tree/master/1.-Johnny-Five-on-Chakra-x86)
2. [ ] [2. Johnny-Five running on Chakra Node ARM (Raspberry Pi)](https://github.com/BrianGenisio/win-io/tree/master/2.-Johnny-Five-on-Chakra-ARM)
3. [ ] [3. Johnny-Five running on Raspberry Pi with the native GPIO](https://github.com/BrianGenisio/win-io/tree/master/3.-Johnny-Five-win-io-layer-for-Raspberry-Pi)
4. [ ] [4. Johnny-Five running on MinnowBoard Max and Galileo using Firmata or win-io](https://github.com/BrianGenisio/win-io/tree/master/4.-Johnny-Five-win-io-layer-for-other-platforms)
